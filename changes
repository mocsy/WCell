- last commit was a bust - accidentally slipped "-a" into the commit command
 -> the last commit also added a big bulk to the new AI spell cast system
 -> this cures things again, including spell targeting which was bugged before
- improved aura stacking logic
- added NPCDifficulty override info to the npc dump
