- WARNING: need to drop DB! (or rename all *region* columns manually)
- renamed Region to Map - basically I did a Find&Replace for *Region* -> *Map* and *region* -> *map*
- renamed SpawnPoint to NPCSpawnPoint
- moved the experimental Spawn-editing code to the DefaultAddon, commented most of it out and removed it's traces from core classes
