- NPCs now cast beneficial spells when roaming
- do not update brain while casting a Spell, unless spellcast is cancelled, to prevent interruption or parallel execution of actions (spellcast + something else)
- let NPCs idle for a short time after they cast a spell, so one gets to see the animation (1s by default)
- fixed AI random cooldowns
- fixed entering combat mode when selecting a combat target
